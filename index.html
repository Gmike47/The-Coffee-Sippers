          <p>So Karl Urban just yanked my coffee cup out of my hands, took a sip, spitted on the floor, trashed my taste in coffee, complained I didn't order tea, and called me a wanker</p>

          <p>I was really surprised to see Barack Obama at my local coffee shop, even more so when he took my coffee without saying a word, taking a sip, giving me a thumbs up and just leaving, with my coffee</p>

          <p>At first I was excited to see Emilia Clarke, but then I wondered why she was dreesed as danerys, and why the guy that play Jorrah was there too. She explained that she needs to see if the coffee had poison and I shouldn't worry about it, I just stood their baffled, as she sipped my coffee and he stood by her with a syringe</p>
